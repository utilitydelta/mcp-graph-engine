# MCP Graph Engine - Session State

## Current Phase
Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Foundation

## Completed Phases
(none yet)

## Next Actions
1. Set up Python project structure with pyproject.toml
2. Create MCP server skeleton with stdio transport
3. Implement NetworkX-based graph engine with DiGraph
4. Implement session manager with named graphs
5. Add basic CRUD operations (add/remove nodes/edges)
6. Implement exact and normalized matching

## Phase Plan
| Phase | Focus | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Core Foundation | Project setup, MCP server, NetworkX integration, session manager, basic CRUD |
| 2 | Fuzzy Matching | sentence-transformers integration, embedding cache, similarity search |
| 3 | Query & Analysis | Path algorithms, PageRank, centrality, components, cycles |
| 4 | Import/Export | DOT, CSV, JSON, GraphML format support |
| 5 | Polish | Error messages, edge cases, comprehensive testing |
