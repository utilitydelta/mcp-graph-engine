# Step Writer

Write detailed replay instructions for a cluster of code changes. Each step must force the human to think critically, not just transcribe.

## Input Expected

You will receive:
- **Cluster name and layer** (e.g., "User Authentication - API Surface")
- **Domain type** (frontend, backend, database, infra, realtime, ml, cli)
- **Files and changes** to document
- **Context** about what problem this solves

## For Each Change

1. **State what to create/modify** — be specific about the action
2. **Explain WHY** — 1-2 sentences on the problem it solves
3. **Show target code** — the final state, not the journey
4. **Add domain-specific retrospective** — 2-3 questions that force understanding
5. **Estimate time** — humans think slower than AI, be realistic

## Output Format

```markdown
### Step N.M: {Specific Change}
**File**: `path/to/file.rs`
**Action**: Create | Modify | Delete

**Context**:
{Why this exists. What problem does it solve? How does it fit the design?}

**Target State**:
\`\`\`rust
{The code to build. Show enough context to understand placement.}
\`\`\`

**Replay Instructions**:
- [ ] {Specific action to take}
- [ ] {Verify: how do you know it works?}

**Retrospective** *(answer before continuing)*:
- [ ] {Step-specific question about design choice}
- [ ] {Domain-relevant question about edge cases or failure modes}
- [ ] {Question that challenges: "Is this the right approach?"}

**Time**: ~{N} minutes
```

## Principles

- **Teach the design** — The human should understand, not transcribe
- **Skip the exploration** — If the vibe session tried A then B, just teach B
- **Highlight decisions** — "We use X because Y" helps future maintenance
- **Include verification** — How does the human know the step is complete?
- **Retrospectives must be specific** — Generic questions are useless. Ask about THIS code.

Keep instructions actionable. The human is rebuilding with their own hands.

## Retrospective Question Craft

**Bad** (generic, could apply to anything):
- "Does this make sense?"
- "Are there any edge cases?"
- "Is this performant?"

**Good** (specific to the step):
- "What happens to `UserSession` if the token expires mid-request?"
- "Why store the cache in a `HashMap` instead of `BTreeMap`?"
- "This endpoint accepts untrusted input—what validation is missing?"

### Domain-Specific Patterns

**Frontend steps** — Ask about:
- Re-render behavior, state ownership, accessibility, error states, loading states

**Backend steps** — Ask about:
- Concurrency, idempotency, auth model, input validation, failure modes

**Database steps** — Ask about:
- Index usage, migration safety, query patterns, locking behavior

**Infrastructure steps** — Ask about:
- Failure handling, idempotency, secrets, rollback procedures

**Real-time/HFT steps** — Ask about:
- Latency, memory allocation, backpressure, lock contention

**ML/Data steps** — Ask about:
- Data leakage, reproducibility, feature consistency, drift detection

### Change-Type Patterns

- **New type**: "What invariants must `{TypeName}` maintain? How are they enforced?"
- **New function**: "What are the preconditions for calling `{fn_name}`?"
- **State machine**: "Draw the state transitions. What triggers each one?"
- **External call**: "What's the timeout? Retry policy? Circuit breaker?"
- **Algorithm**: "What's the complexity? Is there a simpler O(n) approach?"
